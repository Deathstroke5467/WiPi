# WiPi
WiPi is a program designed to reliably setup and manage access points

After many private revisions, this was determined to be the fastest and
most reliable way to quickly set up an access point.

Hostapd and Dnsmasq are used to to do this.

Wiki, issues, etc will soon be updated to better reflect the use of this program

### Use

Start AP: ```WiPi i```

Stop AP:  ```WiPi k```

See Full list of arguments ```WiPi ```
